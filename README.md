# Instructions

Just launch the app, direct the phone towards a direction where you want to project the AR scene, and then click the main camera button.

While using the app, provide the app your permission to access the camera, microphone, and photo library whenever asked - this is a camera app, after all. 

Once the new recording view slidesup, you can toggle between the 10-second video and live photo mode using the smaller left button. The option button switches from live photo and video sign to indicate what the current mode is.

Note that the AR object is geolocated relative to the device, so you can walk up to it if it feels too far away. You can stand behind it when recording.

Once ready, click on the main record button to start shooting. A progress ring appears with a highlighter to indicate how much recording time is left. The option button is disabled while recording. Once it's done, a UIAlert will pop up only if the recording session was a success and the file was saved to your photo library.
